; --- DPMA CONFIGURATION INFORMATION ---
;
; A complete guide on configuring the DPMA is available in the Digium Phones
; section of the Digium's Asterisk Products space of the Asterisk wiki at:
;
; https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/DIGIUM/Digium+Phones
;
; ---- DPMA CONFIGURATION FOR chan_pjsip ----
;
; In order to use the DPMA with the chan_pjsip module a
; default_outbound_endpoint needs to be enabled in pjsip.conf.
; This is accomplised by configuring a basic endpoint to use
; and then setting that endpoint as the default.
;
; Example pjsip.conf settings:
;
; [global]
; type=global
; default_outbound_endpoint=dpma_endpoint
;
; [dpma_endpoint]
; type=endpoint
;
; (see pjsip.conf.sample for more info)
;
; ---- DPMA CONFIGURATION OPTIONS ----
;
; Config and Userlist Authorization Options.
;
; The server_uuid provides a unique identifier for this server.  Notably, this
; is used when forwarding voicemails to contacts local to this server.
;
; server_uuid=abcdefg123
;
; The globalpin represents a global admin pin that is used to pull the config
; of any phone when config_auth is set to globalpin.
; This pin may also be required before a phone user can pull the user list.
;
; globalpin=1234 ; should be something easily entered on a phone keypad
;
; The userlist_auth option specifies what kind of authentication is
; required for a phone to pull the user list. Valid arguments are
; disabled or globalpin.  Setting this to globalpin requires the
; phone user to enter the globalpin value before
; being allowed to get the userlist.
;
; userlist_auth=disabled
;
; The config_auth option specifies what kind of authentication is required
; for a phone to pull a valid config from the server for a user.
; Below are the valid values for this option.
;
; VALID OPTIONS:
; mac - The MAC address alone must match the phone config requested.
; pin - Only the phone's specific password must be valid to
;       retrieve the requested config.
; globalpin - Only the global password (or group_pin, if set on a phone) must
;             be valid to retrieve the config.
; disabled - Configs are served up with no authentication. Any
;            phone can pull any phone configuration defined in this file
;            with no authentication challenges.
;
; config_auth=disabled
;

; mDNS Service Discovery Options
;
; The registration address provided by the DPMA to Avahi. This is the address
; to which phones discovering the DPMA using mDNS will contact.
;
; mdns_address=10.10.10.10
;
; The registration port provided by the DPMA to Avahi. This is the port to
; which phones discovering the DPMA using mDNS will connect.
;
; mdns_port=5060
;
; The transport (udp, tcp, or tls) provided by the DPMA to Avahi.  This is
; the transport which phones dicsovering the DPMA using mDNS will use
; to connect. Defaults to udp.
;
; mdns_transport=udp
;
; The name of the service to be used in mDNS service discovery.
; This will default to "Digium Phones Config Server" when
; service_discovery_enabled is set and the registration address
; and port are present.
;
; service_name=Digium Phones Config Server
;
; Whether or not to advertise the config server using Avahi or not.
; By default this option is set to yes.  The discovery service will only
; be enabled when the registration server and port are explicitly configured.
;
; service_discovery_enabled=yes
;
; Transaction threadpool settings
;
; transaction_initial_threads - Initial number of threads to handle transaction with.
;                               Defaults to 1.
; transaction_max_threads - Maximum number of threads to handle transactions with.
;                           Threads are created as needed by a threadpool. Defaults to
;                           4.

; Files Options
;
; The files directory points to the folder phones are allowed to look in
; to retrieve txt and binary files.  This directory is used for storing
; contacts_display_rules xml files and user provided config files, but may
; be used to serve up binary data as well in the future. By default, this
; directory is located in /var/lib/asterisk/digium_phones.
;
; file_directory=/path/to/files/dir
;

; Other Options
;
; The context used for routing messages in pjsip so that conflicts found in
; in pjsip.conf can be avoided.  Defaults to dpma_pjsip_message_context.
;
; pjsip_message_context=dpma_pjsip_message_context
;
; message_delay - The wait delay, in milliseconds, between multiple messages
;                 that are being transmitted in response to a single request.
;                 Defaults to 5 ms.
;

; ---- GENERAL SECTION EXAMPLE ----
; [general] ; This is already declared above, in this file, and is listed here
            ; for the sake of completion, but do not declare it twice
; server_uuid=abcdefg123
; globalpin=344486

; ---- CONFIGURING NETWORKS ----
; Network profiles are configured by defining a context with type option equal
; to "network." A Network profile contains provisioning information specific to
; a CIDR-numbered network. When the Digium phone boots, it compares its network
; address to the CIDR addresses defined for each of its network profiles, and
; the phone choses to use the provisioning information specific to the network
; on which it is located. Network profiles allow administrators to gracefully
; handle situations where the movement of a Digium phone causes the
; registration address (and other information) of the Asterisk server to change.
;
; More than one Network profile may be assigned to a Digium phone.
;
; NETWORK OPTIONS
; alias - The name for the network, viewable in the phone's preferences menu
;
; cidr - A CIDR-formatted network address
;
; registration_address - Allows for explicit definition of the address to which
;                        phones should register.
;
; registration_port - The port on which the registration server is running â€“ the
;                     same port on which SIP is running on the Asterisk instance.
;
; transport - The transport (udp, tcp, or tls) this registration should use.  Can
;             be overridden by line configuration.  Defaults to udp.
;
; alternate_registration_address - The address to which phones will maintain a
;                                  backup registration, in case the primary server
;                                  becomes unavailable.
;
; alternate_registration_port - The port to use for backup registration.
;
; alternate_transport - The transport (udp, tcp, or tls) this registration should
;                       use.  Can be overridden by line configuration.  Defaults to udp.
;
; file_url_prefix - Specifies the URL prefix the phone module should use to
;                   tell the phones where to retrieve files (only firmware,
;                   currently).
;
; public_firmware_url_prefix - Specifies the URL prefix the phone should use
;                              to download firmware if the phone fails to retrieve
;                              a given firmware from the location specified in its
;                              firmware profile. This will default to a publicly
;                              accessible site hosted by Digium (address:
;                              http://dphone.dl.digium.com/firmware/asterisk/)
;                              if it isn't specified manually. When using firmwares
;                              from a public firmware repository, the path will always
;                              use the following pattern:
;                              public_firmware_url_prefix/VERSION/VERSION_MODEL_firmware.eff
;
; ntp_server - Defines the NTP server to which phones will synchronize themselves
;
; syslog_server - Defines a remote server to which syslog message are sent.
;                 Defaults to none.  Note that syslog must be started with the
;                 '-r' option on the remote host to receive these messages.
;
; syslog_port - Port to which syslog messages are sent. Defaults to 514.
;
; syslog_level - Logging level for syslog messages
;
; network_vlan_discovery_mode - Sets use of NONE, MANUAL, or LLDP discovered
;                               VLAN and, if MANUAL, defines the network.
;                               Defaults to LLDP. These values are case sensitive.
;
; sip_qos - Sets the SIP VLAN QOS level (0-7)
;
; rtp_qos - Sets the RTP VLAN QOS level (0-7)
;
; pc_qos - Sets the PC Port VLAN QOS level (0-7)
;
; network_vlan_id - Sets the VLAN identifier for the Network port
;
; pc_vlan_id - Sets the VLAN identifier for the PC port
;
; sip_dscp - Specifies the DSCP field of the DiffServ byte for SIP Signaling QoS, defaults to 24
;
; rtp_dscp - Specifies the DSCP field of the DiffServ byte for RTP Media QoS, defaults to 46
;
; udp_ka_interval - Specifies the interval in seconds at which keep-alive
;                   packets will be sent if the phone is configured for UDP
;                   transport. Defaults to 0, never.

; ---- CONFIGURING RINGTONES ----
; A Ringtone defines an actual ringing tone to be used by a phone.  When the
; phone is called, a ringtone plays over the phone's speaker.
;
; More than one Ringtone profile may be assigned to a phone
;
; RINGTONE OPTIONS
;
; alias - An identifier for the ringtone, e.g. FancyRinger.  This identifier
;         will be present in the phone's preferences menu and its web menu
;
; filename - A named, 16-bit, 16kHz mono .wav file reachable from the
;            file_url_prefix
;

; ---- RINGTONE EXAMPLE ----
;[fancytone]
;type=ringtone
;alias=FancyTone
;filename=FancyTone.wav

; ---- CONFIGURING FIRMWARES ----
; Firmware profiles define firmwares that can be used by phones as an alternative
; to the firmwares defined in digium_phones_firmware.conf. Firmwares must still
; reside in a web accessible folder that the phones in question can reach to be
; used.
;
; FIRMWARE OPTIONS
;
; model - Model of the phone.  Examples: D40, D50, D70
;
; version - Version of the firmware
;
; file - filename/path of the firmware relative to file_url_prefix
;
; public_firmware - Whether or not we will include a fallback address (based on
;                   the networks' public_firmware_url_prefix) to retrieve this
;                   firmware if the phone can not reach the file specified here.
;                   Default is no.
;
; ---- FIRMWARE EXAMPLES ----
;[firmware-D40_1_1]
;type=firmware
;model=D40
;version=1_1_0_0_48178
;file=1_1_0_0_48178_D40_firmware.eff

;type=firmware
;model=D70
;version=1_1_0_0_48178
;file=1_1_0_0_48178_D70_firmware.eff

; ---- CONFIGURING ALERTS ----
; Alerts define an Alert-Info header, a ringing type and a ringtone to be used
; by the phone. Alerts allow complete customization of the phone's ringing
; behavior
;
; ALERT OPTIONS
;
; alert_info - The Alert-Info header that the phone should expect when this
;              Alert is to be used
;
; ring_type - The type of ringing behavior that the phone should present when
;             this Alert is called, from the following:
;             normal
;             answer
;             ring-answer
;             visual
;
; ringtone - Defines the ringtone to be used for this alert.  If blank, then
;            the phone will not play back a ringing tone, but instead
;            present silence. Can be one of the default tones loaded onto the
;            phone or a context name where type=ringtone

; ---- ALERT EXAMPLE ----
;[alert-fancytone]
;type=alert
;alert_info=ai-FancyTone
;ring_type=ring-answer
;ringtone=fancytone

; ---- CONFIGURING MULTICAST PAGING LISTENERS ----
; Multicast paging entries define an IP and PORT that the phone will listen
; for page announcements on.
;
; MULTICAST PAGE OPTIONS
;
; alias - the display name to use for the page instead of the [section] name
;
; address - the IP address that the page will be sent from
;
; port - the port that the page will be sent on
;
; priority - a lower number will be played in preference to a higher number
;
; interrupt - set to 1 to allow a page to interrupt an active call (default: 0)

; ---- MULTICAST PAGE EXAMPLE ----
;[everyone]
;type=multicastpage
;alias=AllPage
;address=237.0.0.101
;port=32000
;priority=5
;interrupt=0

; ---- CONFIGURING PHONES ----
; Phones are configured by defining a context in res_digium_phone.conf
; with the type option equal to 'phone'. A phone can have any number
; of lines associated with it. Each line defined in the configuration
; is reflected as a separate line key on the phone.
;
; phone line in res_digium_phone.conf is just a sip peer. That's it. When
; we specify a line for a phone, such as 'line=1111', 1111 directly relates
; to a sip peer in sip.conf. We are just telling the phone configuration
; that it owns that sip peer and should register it as one of it's line
; keys on bootup.
;
; The first line associated with a phone config is set internally as the
; phone's primary line. A primary line just means that it is the line that
; will be associated with the phone's configuration when it is chosen from
; the user list on boot up. The primary line can also be used to automatically
; match the phone to voicemail boxes and other user centered features when
; that makes sense. Oftentimes, a user is an extension, so this default matching
; of a voicemail box to the primary line works.
;
; PHONE OPTIONS
; network - Assigns a network profile to a phone. More than one network can be
;           assigned to a phone by using multiple network lines.
;
; mac - When set, this phone configuration is locked to a device
;       matching this mac address.
;
; pin - The configuration pin associated with this specific config. When
;       this is set, one must enter this pin on the phone before being able
;       to pull the phone's configuration.
;
; group_pin - Used in the same places as the 'globalpin' [general] option.
;             This option can be used to provide restricted user lists, or
;             to restrict which phone(s) a user can claim.
;
; line - This option maps directly to a sip.conf peer/user entry. Multiple
;        line options are possible for a single phone configuration. The first
;        line entry defined is adopted as the phone's primary line.
;
; external_line - This option maps directly to a external_line defined in
;        this config file.  External lines are lines not defined by sip
;        peers in sip.conf and may or may not even register to this
;        instance of Asterisk.  Usage of external lines will disable many
;        of the advanced phone application features when the line is the
;        primary extension for a phone.
;
; config_file - The phone module automatically generates a config file
;               for each phone based on the lines assigned to it, but
;               it is possible to supply a custom config file instead.
;               This option allows a custom config file located on disk
;               to be assigned to a specific phone.  By using this option
;               the module will serve up the custom user generated config
;               file rather than generating one for the device.  Config
;               files are assumed to be located in the directory specified
;               by the file_directory option.  Example usage:
;               config_file=mycustomconfig.xml
;
; firmware - Tells the phone to use firmware specified in the given profile
;            instead of the one set in digium_phones_firmware.conf
;            This option may be specified multiple times to cover each model
;            of phone anticipated used.
;
; full_name - The full name of the person who will be using this phone.
;
; contact - An xml file in the file_directory containing a list of contacts
;           to server up to the phone.  Multiple contact options can exist
;           on a single phone configuration.
;
; contacts_display_rules - An xml file in the file_directory containing rules
;                          that control the display of actions when viewing
;                          a contact.
;
; blf_contact_group - Every contact xml file will have at least one contact
;                     group defined in it.  This option defines which contact
;                     group will be subscribed to for user presence and
;                     device status.  The specified group will also be used
;                     for the phone's Rapid Dial keys.
;
; blf_items - An xml file reachable from the file_url_prefix containing a list
;             of items to be displayed on the phone's BLF keys. Only one
;             blf_items option can exist on a single phone configuration.
;
; blf_page_return_timeout - an integer value representing the number of
;                           seconds until BLF page retrieval times out.
;                           Upon reaching the specified timeout the first
;                           page of BLF pages is returned. Defaults to 0.
;
; contacts_max_subscriptions - Sets the maximum number of contacts
;                              subscriptions that a phone can make.
;                              Defaults to 40.
;
; timezone - Sets the timezone used for the clock on this phone.
;            Timezone should be specified as a zone from the IANA Time Zone
;            Database.  Example values:
;              Africa/Cairo
;              America/Los_Angeles
;              America/Denver
;              America/Chicago
;              America/New_York
;              Antarctica/South_Pole
;              Asia/Jakarta
;              Australia/Darwin
;              Europe/Dublin
;
; ntp_resync - Number of seconds until the phone will resync the
;              internal clock with the NTP server.
;
; parking_exten - Sets the extension to park a connected call at. When
;                 this option is set, the phone will display a softkey
;                 on the display during a call allowing for one touch
;                 parking.
;
; parking_transfer_type - The type of transfer to perform when parking a call
;                         using the parking softkey. Valid values are 'blind'
;                         and 'attended'.
;
; show_call_parking - Enables the built-in call parking application.  When
;                     disabled, the one touch call parking softkey works,
;                     but the parking slot is not shown and the parking
;                     lot status cannot be viewed.
;
; ringtone - Loads ringtones onto a phone. More than one ringtone may be loaded
;            onto a phone.
;
; active_ringtone - Sets the active ringtone for the phone.  The available
;                   selections include custom ringtones that have been loaded
;                   onto the phone using the ringtone= option, as well as (but
;                   may not be limited to, depending on the phone's firmware
;                   version) the following:
;            Alarm
;            Chimes
;            Digium
;            GuitarStrum

;
; alert - Defines Alerts to be applied to this phone profile. More than one
;         Alert may be applied by specifying additional alert lines.
;
; multicastpage - Select a multicast page listener to be applied to this phone
;                 profile.  More than one can be applied.
;
; codecs - Enable and disable codecs on this phone profile.  Multiple codecs
;                 can be listed separated by commas.  An exclamation point (!)
;                 prefixing a codec disables it.  The priority of the codecs
;                 is set in the order they appear in the list.  Valid codecs
;                 are:
;
;                 PCMU,PCMA,G722,G7221,G726-32,opus,G729,iLBC,L16,L16-256
;
; web_ui_enabled - By default, when using the Digium Phone Module for Asterisk,
;                  the phone's built-in Web UI is disabled.  To override this
;                  and enable the Web UI anyway, which may result in
;                  unpredictable behavior if the web ui settings conflict with
;                  the settings provided by the DPMA, enable this option.
;
; record_own_calls - Whether a user is able to record their own calls.
;                    Disabled by default.
;
; blf_unused_linekeys - Enabling this option will make unused line keys act as
;                       BLF keys.  Default is false.
;
; send_to_vm - Disabling this option will cause the "Send VM" softkey to
;              disappear on incoming calls, and the "Transfer VM" softkey to

; ---- CONFIGURING LINES ----
; Internal lines are sip peers, but there is Digium Phone specific data
; associated with lines that can not exist in the line's sip.conf
; entry. Because of this, advanced line features must be defined
; separate from sip.conf in the res_digium_phone.conf file. This
; advanced line configuration is not a requirement to get a line to
; work. It only acts as a method of setting advanced phone features
; to an already defined sip.conf entry.
;
; Advanced line features are defined by creating a new context in
; res_digium_phone.conf with the type option equal to "line".
;
; INTERAL LINE OPTIONS... type = line
;
; exten -     When the sip peer name is different than the actual extension
;             used to contact this line, this option should be set to properly
;             set the line's dialable extension.  By default it is assumed that
;             the sip peer name is actual extension, which is true for many
;             Asterisk distributions, such as AsteriskNOW, but is not considered
;             a best practice for use of generic Asterisk.
; digit_map - The digit mapping to use for this line.
; line_label - The line label to display on the phone for this line's line key
;              entry.
; mailbox - The voicemail box associated with the line. When not set and when
;           using chan_sip this will default first to the mailbox defined for
;           the sip peer.  When not set and when using chan_pjsip this will
;           default to an aggregation of mailboxes for aors specified on the
;           associated endpoint.  If no mailboxes are set within either of those
;           configuration files (sip/pjsip) for a line then it will attempt to
;           use a mailbox entry in voicemail.conf matching the name of the line.
;           If neither of these are found and this option is not set, the line
;           does not have a mailbox and visual voicemail will not be enabled.
;
; voicemail_uri - If the phone's msg button should dial a sip URI rather than
;                 opening the visual voicemail application, this option
;                 specifies what uri the msg button should dial.  Note that
;                 setting this option on a phone's primary line will disable
;                 visual voicemail.
;                 Example:
;                 voicemail_uri="sip:user@host"
;
; outboundproxy_address - The outbound proxy address this line should use.
; outboundproxy_port - The outbound proxy port this line should use, defaults
;                      to 5060 when the outboundproxy_addr is set.
;
; plar_number - Specifies the private line automatic ringdown (PLAR) extension.
;               When set the phone will be configured to auto dial the given
;               extension when an outgoing call is attempted.
;
; transport - The transport (udp, tcp, or tls) this phone line should use.  Defaults
;             to udp for all lines.  If not specified, the network transport is used.
; media_encryption - Specify media encryption protocol.  Can be set to sdes,
;                    defaults to not set (none).
; reregistration_timeout=300  ; How often in seconds before re-registering.
; registration_retry_interval=25 ; How many seconds to wait before retrying
;                                ; to register after registration fails.
; registration_max_retries=5 ; How many times the phone will attempt to retry
;                            ; registering after registration fails.
;
; secret - If SIP peers are stored in ARA, then the secret for the SIP peer
;          mapped to this line must be specified so that the Digium phone
;          can be passed the correct SIP peer credentials.  If the SIP peer
;          for this line is specified in sip.conf or pjsip.conf, this option is
;          not required.  Note - if configured in pjsip.conf it attempts to use
;          the first 'auth_pass' found for an associated endpoint's [inbound]
;          auths.
;
; context - If SIP peers are stored in ARA, then the dialplan context to which
;           the SIP peer is assigned must be specified so that dialplan hints
;           can be properly created by the DPMA.  If the SIP peer for this
;           line is specified in sip.conf or on an endpoint in pjsip.conf, this
;           option is not required.

; EXTERNAL LINE OPTIONS... type = external_line
;
; It is possible to configure a line to be external to this Asterisk instance.
; This is done by setting the 'type' option in the in the line configuration
; to 'external_line'. External lines are lines that are not entries in sip.conf
; and may or may not even talk to this specific Asterisk instance. The external
; lines concept exists to lift the limitation of forcing lines to be sip.conf
; peers. Since external lines are not sip peers, they require more information
; than normal line configurations.  Below are the external line specific
; configuration options.  Note that _ALL_ internal line options are present for
; external lines as well, but any internal line options specific to applications
; on the phone, such as mailbox to enable visual voicemail, will not work unless
; the server side component resides on this Asterisk instance.  Picking an
; external line as the primary line for a phone will result in the advanced pbx
; features not being enabled on the phone.
;
; server_address - The address this line should contact for registration and
;                  outbound calls.
; server_port - The port this line should contact for registration and
;               outbound calls. Defaults to 5060.
; secondary_server_address - The address this line should contact for
; registration and outbound calls if the primary one is not available.
; secondary_server_port - The port this line shoudl contact for registration and
;                         outbound calls when the primary one is not available.
;                         Defaults to 5060.
; secondary_server_transport - The transport (udp, tcp, or tls) the secondary phone
;                              line should use.  Defaults to udp for all lines.
; secondary_media_encryptioon - Specify media encryption protocol (sdes).
; userid - This line's sip username.  Defaults to the line's name.
; authname - SIP authorization name if different that userid.
;            Defaults to whatever is in userid when left blank.
; secret - The sip secret if this line should use.
; register - Indicates whether this line should register or not.
; callerid - Caller id field to use for this line.

; status - primary status attribute. All usable values listed below:
;          unavailable, available, away, xa, chat, dnd
; substatus - An arbitrary string used to describe the status. Multiple
;             instances of substatus can be used and each of them will be
;             included as a separate selectable instance to the end-user.
;             It is not necessary to include a substatus.
; send486 - Controls whether a phone sends a 486 response when in the specified status.
;           By default, this is true only for xa and dnd statuses. This option can
;           be used to enable/disable this for any status. Accepted values are "yes"
;           and "no". Any other true/false values normally used by Asterisk also work.

; Voicemail Application
; require_password - pin number entry prompt is displayed for the phone when
;                    using the voicemail application. Failed pin rejects entry.
;                    Default value is "no".
;
; The voicemail application currently only exists to provide localization support
; for the visual voicemail folders and to allow the require_password option to be
; set. It allows a phone user to associate a translation table for the visual
; voicemail application. Example translation tables are below.
;
;
; NOTE: the translation tables for the visual voicemail application are independent
; of the locale chosen for the phone.
